**A.k.a. Gestational Diabetes Guide**

A holistic guide to naturally maintaining your blood sugar levels.

## About this project: 
### The 'What'?
This application provides a guide on how to **manage your blood sugar** during gestational diabetes with a holistic, natural approach. 

Being very passionate about holistic health and natural remedies, having a background in holistic healthcare, and having experience with maintaining my own gestational diabetes and general blood sugar management (to avoid Diabetes Type II) via a holistic and natural approach - I created a degree project during my Front End Developer studies on this subject (based on many, many hours of my own personal research). 

This application 'Graviditetsdiabetesguiden' is expansion on my degree project. üß¨

### The 'How'?
In this application I have expanded on my degree project to enhance it as follows:
- enhanced accessibility (a11y),
- added SEO,
- updated router,
- updated navigation/menu,
- added light/dark theme,
- added SV/EN language options,
- included more useful tools for the visitor (filtering/sorting/saving lists),
- better error handling for 404:s.

I have also published this application on it's own domain, and added SSL.

### The 'Why'?
This project really is a **passion project** of mine, as I strongly believe in the incredible benefits of using a holistic approach and natural remedies to help maintain your blood sugar. I very much hope this guide can prove useful to others!

**Side note**, the advice found here also applies to anyone wishing to maintain a healthy blood sugar via a natural and holistic approach (you don't have to be pregnant with gestational diabetes :) ).

Wishing you all very good health and a stable blood sugar!
All the best & Happy reading!
