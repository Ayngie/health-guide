**A.k.a. Health Guide**


## Overview: 
A playful project to try out some techniques.

## Description:
This application provides a simple health guide, with some categories and subcategories. 

It is a modern, accessible web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite build tool. 

With this project, I wanted to play around with 
- an interactive navigation (collapsible menu built with React state management),
- dynamic routing (using react-router-dom), e.g. ´/health/:area/:articleId´,
- search functionality (client-side) with input sanitization (using sanitize-html),
- a language toggle: Swedish (default)/English translations (using i18next and react-i18next),
- a light/dark mode toggle (theme toggled with help of local storage),
- accessibility and compliance with WCAG-guidelines (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation),
- styling with tailwind css.

Full disclosure: I have sparred with an AI during the process of developing this application, and tweaked code and techniques as I've gone along.
